# Data Incubator Challenge

Two figures have been created as a initial explanatory analysis for only CO2 emissions. 

Figure 1 can be used to answer the following questions:

1. What are the carbon dioxide emission trends from year 2011 to 2014 in the state of Ohio from three main sectors, namely, electricity generation, chemical production and transportation?
2. What are their corresponding contributions to the year?
3. If our goal is to remediate global warming, to which policies we should give higher priorities?

We can infer from the figure that:
The trend of carbon emission from the three main sectors (i.e. electricity generation, chemical production and transportation) is depicted in the top line graph. It suggests that from year 2011, carbon emission first declined in year 2012 and then increased consequentially in year 2013 and 2014, specifically in the state of Ohio. We can infer that power generation sector contributes most to global warming effect, followed by transportation and chemical production. Moreover, their relative contributions have not changed much through the four years. Therefore, if our goal is to remediate global warming, we should give higher priorities for policies that regulate the power generation sector.

Figure 2 is created by extracting CO2 emission information from excel files that contain data for a specific state. The time series data are recorded to calculate progress or retrogress. The ratio of CO2 emission between year 2014 and 2011 are calculated and mapped for continental US. The displayed value is scaled, so the red stands for more emissions in year 2014 than 2011 and the blue stands for the opposite. From such figures, we are more able to focus on regions/states that are getting worse and prioritize remediation practices.

Plans forward:

1. Explore other air pollutants including CO, SO2, NOx, etc. 
2. Besides analyzing the state-level and county-level overview, use facility-level emission data to identify environmental hotspots that suffer from higher air emissions. Such analysis would be beneficial for local government to install remediation green infrastrucure for the community.
3. Identify the most fluential industrial sectors for each typical air pollutants, keep track of their performance over time; and explore the variance within the sector.
4. Create maps at state-, county- and facility-level to provides a more comprehensive emission profile over time and for different air emissions.
